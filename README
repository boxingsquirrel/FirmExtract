===Notes===

Not all items can be decrypted at this point because of missing keys. A log shows after decryption, letting you know what could not be decrypted from your ipsw.

===How to build===

You'll need, in addition to standard build packages: libgtk2.0-dev, libzip-dev, libssl-dev.

Then, issue:
	make
	su
	make install

===Running===

Either use the menu item (under Programming) or run /usr/bin/firmextract. It's a graphical application.

Anyone with a knowledge of C is more than welcome to contribute code.

This tool could use ports to Mac OS X and Windows. Anyone with knowledge in that department, please contact me.

If anyone wants to contribute keys, feel free ;P
