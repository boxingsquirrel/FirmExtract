FirmExtract is a simple utility to extract and decrypt the contents of IPSWs.

===Props===

Some of the code is Copyright Joshua Hill (aka p0sixninja), ripped from idevicerestore.
Parts of XPwn used, see the docs there.
Thanks to boxingcow for Mac cleanup, the guy's awesome (except for that stupid goat).
If I forgot about you, sorry.

===Notes===

Not all items can be decrypted at this point because of missing keys. A log shows after decryption, letting you know what could not be decrypted from your IPSW.

===How to build (Linux)===

You'll need, in addition to standard build packages: libgtk2.0-dev, libzip-dev, libssl-dev.

Then, issue:
	cd linux
	make
	su
	make install

===How to build (Mac OS X)===

You'll need libplist and libzip. Make sure they're somewhere XCode can see them. Open the .xcodeproj in the mac/ folder. Set the target to Release and hit [Command]+B.

===Running (Linux)===

Either use the menu item (under Programming) or run /usr/bin/firmextract. It's a graphical application.

===Running (Mac OS X)===

Drag mac/build/Release/FirmExtract-OSX.app to /Applications and launch it from there.

===Helping Out===

Want to help? 

Anyone with a knowledge of C is more than welcome to contribute code.

This tool could use a port to Windows (32+64 bit). Anyone with knowledge in that department, please contact me.

If anyone wants to contribute keys, feel free ;P
